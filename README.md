## üß† What You'll Learn

This repository covers:

- What **Bad USB attacks** are and how they exploit trusted hardware
- How malicious USB devices (like **Rubber Ducky**) can execute payloads
- Step-by-step tutorials for building **DIY Rubber Ducky devices** using:
  - A generic USB flash drive
  - A **Raspberry Pi Pico**
- Real-world use cases and defensive considerations

Each guide walks you through practical setups, payload scripting basics, and lab-safe demonstrations using low-cost, programmable hardware.
